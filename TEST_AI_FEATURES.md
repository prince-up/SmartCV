## üîß Troubleshooting

### Resume Analysis Not Working

**Check:**
1. Backend is running on port 8000
2. You're logged in (token in localStorage)
3. Resume text is not empty
4. Check browser console for errors

**Common Issues:**
- **401 Unauthorized**: Login again
- **500 Error**: Check backend logs
- **No response**: Gemini API might be rate-limited (fallback will activate)

### Chatbot Not Responding

**Check:**
1. Backend `/ai/chat` endpoint is working
2. You're logged in
3. Internet connection is stable

**Fallback:**
- If Gemini fails, chatbot uses predefined responses
- Still provides helpful guidance

### Gemini API Rate Limits

**Free Tier Limits:**
- 60 requests per minute
- 1,500 requests per day

**If you hit limits:**
- Fallback system activates automatically
- Still provides analysis (keyword-based)
- Wait a few minutes and try again

- Better performance
- More features
