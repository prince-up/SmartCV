# Job Match - Auto Resume Detection

## ✅ Enhanced Features

### Automatic Resume Detection
When you open Job Match, it automatically:
1. Checks if you have a resume (skills in database)
2. Shows your skills count
3. Prompts you to create resume if none found
4. Uses YOUR actual skills for matching

## 🎯 How It Works

### On Page Load:
```
1. Check Skills Count
   ↓
2. If 0 skills → Show Upload Prompt
   ↓
3. If skills exist → Show "Resume Loaded" banner
   ↓
4. Ready for real-time analysis
```

### When Analyzing Job:
```
1. User pastes job description
   ↓
2. System checks: Do they have skills?
   ↓
3. If NO → Show error + prompt to create resume
   ↓
4. If YES → Analyze with their actual skills
   ↓
5. Show real-time match results
```

## 📊 Status Banners

### No Resume Found (Yellow Banner):
- **Shows:** "No Resume Found!"
